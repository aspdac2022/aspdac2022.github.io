                <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                Quantum computers will achieve disruptive capabilities only if they can overcome their intrinsic
                sensitivity to quantum error sources. These error sources, if unmitigated, lead to inaccurate and
                incorrect quantum computing solutions. I will describe the current status of quantum computing
                capabilities, key challenges, and the roadmap to achieving quantum advantage in the future. I will
                present some of our state-of-the-art results from current generation quantum computing platforms that
                leverage Quantum Benchmark's error-mitigating software solutions.

                <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                High reliability and availability are requirements for most technical systems including computer and
                communication systems. Reliability and availability assurance methods based on probabilistic models is
                the topic addressed in this talk. Non-state-space solution methods are often used to solve models based
                on reliability block diagrams, fault trees and reliability graphs. Relatively efficient algorithms are
                known to handle systems with hundreds of components and have been implemented in many software packages.
                Nevertheless, many practical problems cannot be handled by such algorithms. Bounding algorithms are then
                used in such cases as was done for a major subsystem of Boeing 787. Non-state-space methods derive their
                efficiency from the independence assumption that is often violated in practice. State space methods
                based on Markov chains, stochastic Petri nets, semi-Markov and Markov regenerative processes can be used
                to model various kinds of dependencies among system components. Linux Operating System and WebSphere
                Application server are used as examples of Markov models. IBM research cloud is used as an example of
                stochastic Petri net model. However, the state space explosion of such models severely restricts the
                size of the problem that can be solved. Hierarchical and fixed-point iterative methods provide a
                scalable alternative that combines the strengths of state space and non-state-space methods and have
                been extensively used to solve real-life problems. Real-world examples of such multi-level models from
                IBM, Cisco and Sun Microsystems will be discussed. Hardware systems as well as software systems and
                their combinations will be addressed via these examples. Novel approaches to software fault tolerance
                will be discussed. These methods and applications are fully described in a recently completed book:

                Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software has delivered semiconductor design productivity improvements
                for decades. The next leap in productivity will come from the addition of machine learning (ML)
                techniques to the toolbox of computational software capabilities employed by EDA developers. Recent
                research and development into machine learning for EDA point to clear patterns for how it impacts EDA
                tools, flows, and design challenges. This research has also illustrated some of the challenges that will
                come with production deployment of machine learning techniques into EDA tools and flows. This tutorial
                will detail patterns observed in ML for EDA development. The advantages and disadvantages of different
                ML approaches as well as the challenges for deployment in EDA developments will be discussed. Specific
                examples of different ML approaches in the EDA domain will be presented, and the opportunities and open
                questions for future research will be shown.

                <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                Heterogeneous Integration refers to the assembly and packaging of multiple separately manufactured
                components in order to improve functionality and enhance operating characteristics. And it allows for
                the packaging of components of different functionalities, different process technologies, different
                materials and sometimes separate manufacturers.<br><br>

                Since Moore’s Law scaling pace has been slowing down, increasing functionality of monolithic die on the
                same area and/or same footprint by System on Chip (SoC) without increasing cost per transistors becoming
                difficult. Heterogenous Integration technology building blocks such as 3D integration, Chiplets, and
                embedded dies into packaging substrate implementation into System-in-Package (SiP) provides alternative
                solutions to both microelectronics industry and electronics systems with shorter time to market and
                affordable cost.<br><br>

                In this tutorial, introduce current status of Heterogeneous Integration technology, its building blocks,
                use case examples e.g. 5th Generation Mobile Communication (5G), Ambient Assisted Living, Artificial
                Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Driving, Industry 4.0, Health Care, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain
                and roadmap toward 2030 will be discussed.

                This tutorial covers three topics:<br><br>

                <!--<strong>1. Thin-film Processing Based Manufacturing Technology for Phase Change Memory (PCRAM)</strong><br>-->
                <strong>1. Manufacturing Technology of Phase Change Memory for Storage Class Memory and AI
                    Applications</strong><br>
                Koukou Suu (Ulvac Technologies, Inc.)<br>
                Thin-film functional material such as phase-change (Ge2Sb2Te5) and selector materials have been
                utilizing to form advanced semiconductor devices including Phase-Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM) for
                Storage Class memory (Ge-As-Se) and analog Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this talk, we will give
                presentation our development activities of phase-change material thin- film processing technologies
                including sputtering, ALD/CVD as well as manufacturing processes for Phase-Change Random Access Memory
                (PCRAM).<br><br>

                <strong>2. 3D NAND Flash Memory, Manufacturing Technology and Trend</strong><br>
                Yoshihiro Hirota (Tokyo Electron Limited)<br>
                NAND Flash memory was invented in 1980s and the first paper in the world was published in IEDM 1987 by
                F. Masuoka Group, Toshiba. The bit density has been increased by the scaling technology of manufacturing
                process, and the structure has been changed from 2D to 3D structure to increase the bit density.
                Recently, 3D NAND with 128 WLs has been developed and shipped, and the bit density has been achieved to
                7.8Gbit/mm<sup>2</sup>. A general manufacturing process flow of 3D NAND and some key processes are
                introduced. The aggressive manufacturing process technologies are visually shown. High aspect ratio
                etching process technology is highly aggressive to fabricate the memory cell holes. The aspect ratio
                becomes more than 45 now. The conformal thin film deposition technology into the memory cell holes with
                vertical structure is also highly aggressive.<br>
                Vertical scaling, horizontal scaling and electrical scaling are challenging to increase the bit density
                today. In vertical scaling, there are stack layer increase, shrink of each layer thickness and others.
                In horizontal scaling, there are the scaling of the memory cell hole layout, an introduction of Circuit
                (or CMOS) under Array (CuA) structure and other new structures. Finally, electrical scaling challenge is
                multi bit cell technology. There are Floating Gate type and Charge Trap Film type in 3D NAND. The
                advantages and disadvantages of both type NANDs are also discussed.<br><br>

                <strong>3. Carbon nanotube and its Electronic Device Applications</strong><br>
                Shigemi Murakawa (Zeon Corporation)<br>
                This tutorial reviews the manufacturing method of the single-walled carbon nanotube and its advantageous
                characteristics such as extremely low impurities, high specific surface area and high electric
                conductivity. Also described are its various device applications including non-volatile memory,
                high-density capacitor, electric elastomer, microwave-shielding film and the thermo-electric conversion
                device. Here, the adaptive design and operation of the device are important, considering the process and
                material-characteristics windows. Also, the AI-based QC system which covers from the material
                characteristics to the device performance is highly expected.
