                <p style="text-align:justify;">
                    Machine learning (ML) for IC design often faces the challenge of "small data" due to its nature. It
                    takes a huge amount of time and effort to go through multiple P&R flows with various tool settings,
                    constraints, and parameters for obtaining useful training data of ML-enabled EDA. In this regard,
                    systematic and scalable execution of hardware design experiments, together with standards for
                    sharing of data and models, is an essential element of ML-based EDA and chip design. In this
                    tutorial, we describe the effort taken in IEEE CEDA Design Automation Technical Committee (DATC)
                    toward a standard platform for ML-enabled EDA and IC design. We first overview the challenges in
                    ML-enabled EDA and review the related previous efforts. We then present DATC RDF and METRICS2.1,
                    followed by hands-on working examples of (1) large-scale design experiments via cloud deployment,
                    (2) extracting, collecting, and analyzing METRICS data from large-scale experiment results, and (3)
                    flow auto-tuning framework for PPA optimization via METRICS2.1 realization. We will provide the
                    working examples used throughout the tutorial via a public code repository, which include full
                    RTL-to-GDS flow, codebases, Jupyter notebooks, and cloud deployment sample codes.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">In recent years, deep learning technologies achieved excellent performance and many breakthroughs in
                    both academia and industry. However, the state-of-the-art deep models are computationally expensive
                    and consume large storage space. Deep learning is also strongly demanded by numerous applications
                    from areas such as mobile platforms, wearable devices, autonomous robots, and IoT devices. How to
                    efficiently apply deep models on such low power devices becomes a challenging research problem. In
                    recent years, Low-bit Neural Network (NN) Computing has received much attention, due to its
                    potential to reduce the storage and computation complexity of NN inference and training. This
                    tutorial introduces the existing efforts on low-bit NN computing. This tutorial includes three
                    parts: 1) Algorithms towards more accurate low-bit NNs; 2) Binary neural network design and
                    inference; 3) Low-bit training of NNs.
                <br>
                    Firstly, quantized neural networks with low-bit weights and activations are attractive for
                    developing AI accelerators. However, the performance of low-bit neural networks is usually much
                    worse than that of the corresponding full-precision counterparts. Firstly, the quantization
                    functions are non-differentiable, which increases the optimization difficulty of quantized networks.
                    Secondly, the representation capacity of low-bit values is limited, which also limits the
                    performance of quantized networks. This talk will introduce several methods to obtain
                    high-performance low-bit neural networks, including better optimization manners, better network
                    architecture and a new quantized adder operator.
                <br>
                    Secondly, this talk will present the recent progress of binary neural networks, including the
                    development process and the latest model design. It will also give out some preliminary verification
                    results of BNNs using hardware accelerator simulation in terms of accuracy and energy consumption.
                    The presenter will further provide an outlook on prospects and challenges of AI accelerators based
                    on BNNs.
                <br>
                    Finally, training CNNs is time-consuming and energy-hungry. Using low-bit formats has been proved
                    promising for speeding up and improving the energy efficiency of CNN inference by many studies,
                    while it is harder for the training phase of CNNs to benefit from such techniques. This talk will
                    introduce the challenge and recent progress of low-bit NN training. Also, this talk will elaborate
                    on hardware architecture design principles of efficient quantized training.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify;">Since the report of simple and differential power analysis in the late 1990’s, side channel analysis (SCA) has been one of the most important and well-studied topics in hardware security. In this tutorial, we will share our insights and experience on SCA by a combination of presentations, embedded demos, and an interactive panel discussion. The three speakers are from academia and industry with rich experience and solid tracking record on hardware security research and practice.<br>
                    We will start the tutorial with a comprehensive introduction of SCA, including the popular side channels that have been exploited by attackers, common countermeasures, and the simulation based SCA with commercial EDA tools. Then we will present industry proven flows for fast and effective pre-silicon side channel leakage analysis (SCLA) with focus on physical level power and electromagnetic (EM) side channels. Next, we elaborate how to perform on-chip and in-system side-channel leakage measurements and assessments with system-level assembly options on crypto silicon chips with the help of embedded on-chip noise monitor circuits. We will conclude the presentations with some forward-looking discussion on emerging topics such as SCA for security, SCA in AI and machine learning (ML), and pre-silicon SCLA assisted by AI/ML. Multiple short video clips will be embedded to showcase SCA by simulation and silicon measurement.<br>
                    No prior knowledge is required to attend this tutorial. The audience is expected to learn the foundations and state-of-the-arts in SCA with some hands-on skills.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">With the fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), introducing sparsity becomes a key enabler for both practical deployment and efficient training in various domains. On the other hand, sparsity does not necessarily translate to efficiency, sparse computation loses to its dense counterpart in terms of throughput. To enable efficient AI computation based on sparse workloads in the future, this tutorial focuses on the following issues: (1) From the algorithm perspective. Compressing deep learning models by introducing zeros to the model weights has proven to be an effective way to reduce model complexity, which introduces sparsity to the model. The introduction of fine-grained 2:4 sparsity by NVIDIA A100 GPUs has renewed the interest in efficient sparse formats on commercial hardware. This tutorial compares different pruning methodologies and introduces several efficient sparse representations that are efficient on CPUs and GPUs. (2) From the kernel perspective. Many AI applications can be decomposed into several key sparse kernels, and the problem can be broken down into acceleration for sparse kernels. Different from dense kernels like general-purpose matrix multiplication (GEMM) which can utilize the peak performance of GPU hardware, sparse kernels like sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) achieves low FLOPs, and performance is closely related to the implementation. In this tutorial, we will introduce how to optimize sparse kernels on GPUs with several simple but effective methods. (3) From the hardware perspective. In the existing architecture, the efficiency of dense GEMM operations is getting higher and higher, and the performance is constantly being squeezed. To improve computing efficiency and reduce energy consumption, sparse tensor processing has been placed in an increasingly important position by designers. The main challenges of sparse tensor processing are limited bandwidth, irregular memory access, and fine grain data processing, etc. In this tutorial, we will present some Domain Specific Architectures (DSAs) for sparse tensors in GPGPUs and provide an overview of trends of development.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Scan chain is one of the most powerful and popular design for test (DfT) technologies as it provides test engineers the unrestrictive access to the internal states of the core under test. This same convenience has also made scan chain an exploitable side channel for attackers to steal the cipher key of cryptographic core or combinational logic designed for obfuscation. In this tutorial, we will first present the preliminaries of scan-based DfT technology. Then we will illustrate the vulnerabilities against scan side-channel attacks and SAT attacks and review the existing countermeasures on how to design secure scan-based DfT to resist these attacks. Next, we will discuss how to utilize scan-based DfT as a security primitive to provide solution for several hardware security problems including: hardware intellectual property protection, physical unclonable function and device authentication.<br>
                    This tutorial targets two groups of audience: (1) graduate students interested in IC testing (in particular scan chain) and security, (2) researchers and engineers from industry and academic working on IC testing and hardware security. No prior knowledge on scan-based DfT or security is required to attend this tutorial. The audience is expected to learn the foundations and state-of-the-arts in secure scan design.</p>
